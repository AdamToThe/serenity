      The maximum number of times that an invite may be used before it expires.

      Note that this does not supercede the [`max_age`] value, if the value of
      [`temporary`] is `true`. If the value of `temporary` is `false`, then the
      invite _will_ self-expire after the given number of max uses.

      If the value is `0`, then the invite is permanent.
